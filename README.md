# OMT-with-Flux-rate-Constraint
Here is the code of our paper: Monge-Kantorovich Optimal Transport Through Constrictions and Flow-rate Constraints
A copy of the paper can be found from:


This project contains all the simulation in Section 3&4 of the paper and details of the code design are included in the manual.pdf
Please feel feel to reach out if you have any questions.


The Matlab code requires the optimization toolbox: CVX can be downloaded from the above link.

The solver MOSEK is highly recommended for this task, see
http://web.cvxr.com/cvx/doc/mosek.html 
for more information.

The code works for Matlab 2019a, 2019b.
