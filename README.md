# OMT-with-Flux-rate-Constraint
Here is the code of our paper: Optimal Transport with Flux-rate Constraints
The preprint can be found here:

The Matlab code requires the optimization toolbox: CVX can be downloaded from the above link.

The solver MOSEK is highly recommended, see
http://web.cvxr.com/cvx/doc/mosek.html 
for more information.

The code works for Matlab 2019a, 2019b.
We provide the numerical simulation result for all of the experiments in the paper.
